# BareConductive_visualiser
Processing and P5.js code for visualising BareConductive board serial input. 

## Processing
This is an adaptation of the code provided by Bare Conductive [**here**](https://github.com/BareConductive/simple_touch_board_sketch)

This version also includes serial input of FDAT (filtered data) too in order to visualise proximity. 
In addition a Bar Class was created to visualise touch and release interactions. 

## P5.js
This code is converted from the Processing version into javascript. In order to use the Bare Conductive board with P5.js you must include the **p5-serial library** found [**here**](https://github.com/p5-serial/p5.serialport)

- Follow the guidelines detailed in the link above to enable interaction between Serial and p5.js
- You can use the serial App or node.js to do this. 
- You'll likely have to change the name of the serial port in the examples to the one your Arduino is using.

You can run this code in the new p5 web editor and see a version that can be duplicated [here](https://editor.p5js.org/j3nsykes/sketches/7JEyzf440)
